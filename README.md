# Employee_Tracker
The Employee Tracker application is solution for managing a Company's employees using node, inquirer and MySQL.

It allows the user to Add, View, Update and Delete every Department, Roles, Managers and Employees.  The user can also view the total utilised budget of the selected Department.

## Installation
To be able to keep this application up and running, dependencies are needed to be install such as npm inquirer and npm mysql. It also needs to have the correct connection with the database.

After running the server.js, the user will be prompted with choices and can start selecting using the arrow keys.

I created a 4 linked .js file to make it easier to debug incase there will be an error.
